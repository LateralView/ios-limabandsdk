Lima Band SDK allows you to interact with Bluetooth wearable exercise bands, receive live step count values and historic data. Currently only Xiaomi Mi Band is supported.

Please [check the documentation](DOCS.md) for more information about using this framework.

## Example App

The SDK includes a demo app that you can use to check compatibility with your bluetooth band. To run it, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

In order to test the SDK successfully you are going to need a [Xiaomi Mi Band](http://www.mi.com/en/miband/) and a real iOS device (the iOS Simulator won't work).  

## Installation

limabandsdk is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'limabandsdk', :git => 'https://github.com/LateralView/ios-limabandsdk.git'
```
